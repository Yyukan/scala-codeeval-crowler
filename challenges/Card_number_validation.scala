/**
 * CARD NUMBER VALIDATION
CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

To check whether a bank card number is valid or it is it just a set of random numbers, Luhn formula is used.

The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This account number must pass the following test:

From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit;
if the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (for example, 7Ã—2=14), then sum the digits
of the products (for example, 12:1+2=3, 14:1+4=5).
Take the sum of all the digits.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then, according to the Luhn formula, the number is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.
Examples of formula calculation and result checking:
